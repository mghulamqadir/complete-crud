# Complete CRUD CLI

Complete CRUD CLI is a command-line tool that generates a fully functional Express and MongoDB CRUD application. It creates a complete project structure including controllers, routes, models, server setup, and MongoDB connection.

---

## Features

- Automatically generates CRUD operations using Express and MongoDB
- Organized project structure following best practices
- Interactive prompts to define schema fields
- Includes .env setup, server configuration, and database connection
- Ready to run and easily extendable

---

## Installation

To install globally via npm:

```bash
npm install -g complete-crud
```

---

## Usage

To run the CLI:

```bash
complete-crud
```

You will be prompted to:
- Confirm if you want to generate a CRUD app
- Enter field names for your MongoDB model
  - Type `no-more` when you're done adding fields

A complete project will be generated in a folder named `crud-app` in your current directory.

## Project Structure

```
crud-app/
├── controllers/
│   └── item.controller.js
├── models/
│   └── Item.model.js
├── routes/
│   └── item.routes.js
├── utils/
│   └── db.js
├── .env
├── app.js
├── server.js
├── package.json
```

---

## Example

```bash
$ complete-crud

? Generate full CRUD with MongoDB? … yes
? Enter a field name (or type "no-more" to finish): name
? Enter a field name (or type "no-more" to finish): email
? Enter a field name (or type "no-more" to finish): no-more

Project created at /your/path/crud-app
```

The generated schema will look like this:

```js
const itemSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: { type: String, required: true },
  email: { type: String, required: true },
}, { timestamps: true });
```
